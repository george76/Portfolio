					<p>Problem</p>
							
					<div class="header-underline">&nbsp;</div>
						<div>
							<h1>The problem that Syze presented, is that the technology for the app is still being developed.</h1>
							<br>
							<h1>My problem as the designer,  was to visualise a few screens for the app that would capture essential data for the app so it could deliver to users a superior shopping experience.</h1>
						<div/>

					<p>Process</p>

						<div>
							<h1>The usual approach to projects couldn’t be applied in this case. Syze required a very simple approach of capturing the key details you would expect to be collected during any on-boarding process.</h1>
							<br>

							<h1>The difference in this case was the unique problem of capturing that information by using the users mobile devices built-in camera and microphone. </h1>
							<br> 

							<h1>By initially scamping out my first few iterations of how I imagined the app would capture this information. I was continually aware that the designs not only needed to be visible on screen when being held but also from a short distance.</h1>	
							<br>

							<h1>The visibility of these few screens was key to the success of the app. Slight modifications were applied when the wireframes were being designed. It was clear that each personal detail required it’s own screen.</h1>

						<div>
							<h1>The prototyping stage of the process was where the app came to life.</h1>
							<br>
							<h1>Apart from a few minor user interactions with the app, the majority of the screens that I built were focused around the users movements while their devices is placed on the ground.</h1>
							<br>
							<h1>The prototyping tool I used allowed me to build in transitions from screen to screen as the user changed their position. </h1>
							<br>
							<h1>The visual transitions are accompanied with audio cues, instructing the user though their image gathering process.</h1>

					<p>Conclusion</p>
							
					<div class="header-underline">&nbsp;</div>
						<div>
							<h1>Designing for new technology is something that really excites me as there are really no limits to what you can design, within reason. There’s no benchmark against or similar products to compare to. I pretty much had a blank canvas.</h1>
							<br>

							<h1>That said, there were still some standard tasks the app needed to fulfill before I could get carried away with how it behaved.</h1>
							<br>
							<h1>The transitions that I incorporated into the app, gave a calm and confident feel to the app. This allows the user to relax and simply focus on slowing walking through the apps directions. </h1>
							<br>
							<h1>The brief was a fun creative challenge that hopefully improves how users shop online in the future. I look forward to continuing my role in the next chapter of this apps development.</h1>
