							<h1>After meeting with the stakeholders, it was clear that the existing site needed to be tested by a suitable number of users from their target demographic.</h1>
							<br>

							<h1>By undertaking a heuristic evaluation of the site I was able to understand the pain points user where currently having with it.</h1>
							<br> 

							<h1>Once the Usability Testing was complete, I had over a dozen users who had experienced similar issues with the site and had trouble achieving the tasks I challenged them with.</h1>	
							<br>

							<h1>I already knew that by simply removing a lot of the unnecessary noise from the site and by focusing on only what the user requires, the site would be vastly improved.</h1>

							<h1>With the foundations for the website approved from the wireframes, I  progressed the designs into prototyping them in Adobe XD.</h1>

							<h1>Positioning the various elements on the artboard was seamless as there was a strong hierarchy of font weights and palette usage already in place thanks to the brand guidelines that were created as part of the redesign.</h1>
							<br>
							<h1>The clean and clear theme was supported by the vibrant blue that helped to create a friendlier look and feel to the responsive website.</h1>

					<p>Conclusion</p>
							
					<div class="header-underline">&nbsp;</div>
						<div>
							<h1>What was uncovered when I tested the existing site was consistent with what the client had already informed me, that users where experiencing issues and were continually failing to achieve their goals.</h1>
							<br>

							<h1>Ultimately, along the user journey the users were getting frustrated. What the user testing managed to do was pinpoint the exact location users lost their patience.</h1>
							<br>
							<h1>After a brief questionnaire, followed by some open conversation, I was able to understand what the users expected from the site and how basic affordances weren’t being applied. </h1>
							<br>
							<h1>The project was a great example of how, as designers we need to encourage our clients, to understand that when it come to designing any user interface, it's imperative that we keep it simple.</h1>
