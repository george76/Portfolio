						<div>
							<h1>The problem is that studies investigating the neuroscience of disorders of brain health are too small. If we want to advance the science using new techniques such as machine learning (for prediction/classification), we need larger numbers of people to participate in research, and we need them to do so over time. This is the key citizen science angle. Its a group effort.</h1>

							<h1>When I got involved in the project, some screens had already been visualised and a few games had been developed.</h1>
							<br>

							<h1>After setting up a few sessions of user testing of the app and in particular, the games, I was able to get a better understanding of the various pain points user were experiencing.</h1>
							<br> 

							<h1>The sign up process was very cumbersome, causing users to get frustrated. This theme continued into the game play with multiple screen tutorials before users got to play.</h1>	
							<br>

							<h1>By streamlining the login process and removing unnecessary screens, I was able dramatically reduce the user journey, creating a greater user experience.</h1>

						<div>
							<h1>Designing an app that is purely for research purposes was always going to be interesting. How do you convince users to get involved in a research that may or may not have any relevance to them directly?</h1>
							<br>

							<h1>What I did know was that is was essential to make a potentially confusing and frustrating experience anything but that. </h1>
							<br>
							<h1>The use of games that challenged the users mental memory and cognition are positive experiences to engage with. It was obvious to me that the seriousness of the app had to offset against a friendly and bright interface.</h1>
							<br>
							<h1>The constant use of curved icons and graphics helps to maintain this theme and added to making the experience a pleasurable one.  </h1>
							<br>
							<h1>Working on a project like this has that added value for me as it ticks the box of designing for a greater purpose. </h1>
